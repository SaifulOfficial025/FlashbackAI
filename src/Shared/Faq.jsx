    q: "Do I need any technical skills?",
    a: "Not at all! PureMotion is designed for everyone. Simply upload your photo, choose a style, and we handle the rest. The entire process is intuitive and takes less than a minute.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take?",
    a: "Most videos are generated in under 30 seconds with our optimized AI processing. More complex animations may take up to 60 seconds depending on your photo quality and selected style.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I choose the animation style?",
    a: "Yes! You can choose from cinematic, nostalgic, gentle movement, or natural lifelike motion styles. Each style is designed to respect the emotional value of your photos while bringing them to life.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my photo safe?",
    a: "Absolutely. Your photos are encrypted during upload and processing. We automatically delete all photos from our servers after 24 hours, and you can manually delete them at any time. Your privacy is our top priority.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I download/share my video?",
    a: "Yes! Once your video is generated, you can download it in high quality and share it with anyone you love. Your videos are yours to keep forever.",
